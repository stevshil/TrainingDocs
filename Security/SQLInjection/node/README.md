# NodeJS SQL Injection and Snyk

This example has multiple issues including SQL Injection issues.

The API simply deals with users, but this shows that you don't need to use a form attached to a database code to have SQL Injection issues, as APIs can still allow this.

The code also has comments to help improve on the security of the code using Snyk to help find the problems.
