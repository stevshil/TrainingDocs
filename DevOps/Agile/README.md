# Agile quickly

## About

> **Dictionary definition:** to move quickly and easily

* What is Agile and why do we do it?
    <details>

    * Agile is a way of **life** and not just tools or frameworks, but how a team can sucessfully deliver software to a client and adapt to the clients changes in requirements.

    * [Agile 101](https://agilealliance.org/agile101/)
    * [Agile Manifesto](https://agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/)

    * **Waterfall** required long periods of time, normally many months, if not years before a client received any form of working product. Even then there was no guarantee it would meet their needs by the time it was delivered as the market would have changed and adapted.

* What is the of goal Agile development?

    <details>

    > Deliver working software frequently.

    * The software is not only working, but meets the requirements of the client for that particular **release** phase.  The release must bring value to the client, even if it does not contain all their requirements/wishes.

    * Acheived through processes and tools, such as Scrum, Kanban, Pair Programming, Stand-ups, Spring planning.

## Agile favours ...

The manifesto defines 

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## The product owner

* Identifies the customers needs and prioritises the requirements of the client
* A backlog is then created of these requirements

### User stories

User stories define requirements based on the user's needs.  These needs are based on how they wish to interact with the software and how their business operates.

#### Exercise

* Write me 10 user stories for either;
    * A shopping cart
        * This is the part just before you pay
    * or to create an ETL pipeline to clean and filter data from 3 different sources;
        * Yahoo Finance Data
        * FTSE stocks information and news
        * The BBC news feeds

        And provide a data product that consists of;

        * test data
        * training data
        * production data

* What should be in a user story?
    * As a user I want to
    * Acceptance criteria
* Capturing the needs and outcomes

### Sizing and estimates

The product owner will then work with the team to size the tasks in to manageable sprints.

* The backlog is then prioritised using Sprints (of 2 weeks, sometimes 4, sometimes none) to meet the client needs based on the product owner's knowledge.
* Sprint planning requires sizing of tasks
    * As a team we may be working across teams with different capabilities and skills
    * Sizes are arbitrary values which do not adhere to time, but complexity of a task
        * https://www.parabol.co/blog/agile-estimation-techniques/
        * Relative Sizing = T-Shirts, Fibonacci
        * Poker = Numbering system where cards are used with numbering system
    * An Epic is a task size that is too complex or long and needs to be broken into smaller sub-tasks.  E.g. in Poker 13 is normally considered an Epic.

#### Exercise

* Using your shopping cart or data ETL exercise, identify the size of these tasks.  The product will be created in products that your team already has experience in.
* Identify which value will be considered as an Epic.
		
## The team

During the sprint the team will conduct stand ups (max 15 minutes, depending on team size)
    - What you did yesterday
    - What you're doing today
    - Any blockers = the key
Any long discussions are taken off line after the stand up

At the end of a sprint we perform a retrospective

This is to gain insights into how well we thought we did during the sprint, and to congratulate our successes.

* What went well
* What could have been better
* What we shouldn't do again
