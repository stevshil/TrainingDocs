# Knowledge and Catalogue Articles

When resolving incidents we start to build up a knowledge base of information that will help future engineers and support specialists fix issues faster by reviewing the past incidents and documentation that those before have dealt with.

These knowledge articles can be viewed through incidents when a search in the incident form brings up something related in the article.

## Creating a knowledge article

To create a knowledge article select **Knowledge** from the left navigation menu, or search for **Knowledge** in the **Filter navigator**.

Your organization may have different **Knowledge bases** so you'll need to know where to place the document.  For this exercise we will use **Knowledge**.

* Click **Knowledge**
* Click the blue document icon at the top right of the main area

  * Knowledge base - allows you to change which section the article belongs
  * Category - your company may have different categories for documentation, such as development, platforms, etc
  * Valid to - allows you to specify a date that the document is valid for.
  * Article type - defines how it is shown, HTML or Wiki style.
  * Type your detail into the document area
  * Click **Submit**

## Finding your articles

NOTE: your article does not show up in the main **Knowledge** area, so do a search from **Knowledge** and you'll see a **My Knowledge Articles**.  Click this to see the articles you created.

## Publishing your article

From your **My Knowledge Articles** select the **Number** that you wish to publish.

At the bottom of the page there is an area where users of the system can provide feedback, and check approvals.

You'll also notice that documents can be **Retire**d.

Click the **Publish** button.  This will take you back to the list, and you'll see new icons in the **Workflow** column.

Once your document is published it will appear in the section that you created it in.  In this case the **Knowledge** section.

## Viewing your article in an Incident

Go to or create a new incident.

In the **Related search** text box type in part of the short description for your article and press ENTER.

Your article should appear in the list under the search box if it has been published.

You can click on the title to view the documentation.

You can also click **Attach** to link it to the incident.  This will add a new comment to the incident with a link to the document, so you'll need to click **Update** to save the change.
